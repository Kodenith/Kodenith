Most of the stuff you'll find on here are little useless thingamajigs for practise. But sooner or later i'll try my best to create and contribute to tons of useful stuff! :D

> Below are some less interesting stuff from a coder's perspective, but theyre here for a reason - theyre pretty cool and also give you more info on me.

<h2 align="center">Kodenith, the Character</h2>

As i said, im a furry. dont start throwing tomatoes at me please, for i am not a bad person and if you see the entire fandom like that, you should consider searching up what a furry even is and actually read it.

Now, my character is a synth, Synths are basically robot lizard thingies made by VaderSan. [More info on synths here.](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Main_Page)

He's a cyclop, one big eye on his forehead. never really saw anyone think of such design, so i decided to be the first one to do it.

> I Didn't actually make the model, its based on a base. (dun dun tss)
> Base was made by Zairiza

Kodenith is basically my online persona, thats who i am on the web!
