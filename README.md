*By no means am i perfect on them*, but i use them a lot. mostly because i make games with **Unity** and i dont plan on making asset flips anytime soon.
Well, thats most of my main information on myself. i will continue to update this readme if some stuff changes so no worries! :D

> Below are some less interesting stuff from a coder's perspective, but theyre here for a reason - theyre pretty cool and also give you more info on me.

<h2 align="center">Kodenith, the Character</h2>

As i said, im a furry. dont start throwing tomatoes at me please, for i am not a bad person and if you see the entire fandom like that, you should consider searching up what a furry even is and actually read it.

Now, my character is a synth, Synths are basically robot lizard thingies made by VaderSan. [More info on synths here.](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Main_Page)

Not much lore really, actually there's plenty but i dont want to start a whole book in a github readme sooooooo... yeah.

He's a cyclop synth, one big eye on his forehead. never really saw anyone think of such design, so i had to do it. (especially because i love [Patapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patapon))

> I Didn't actually make the model, its based on a base. (dun dun tss)
> Base was made by Zairiza

Kodenith is **quite literally me**, same passion, same personality, same everything. Essentially an *online me*. when people think of me they think of him.

*I Really like reptiles, i think people need to appreciate them more, mostly because uhh... **they exist!** and i love them. dont know why but still. theyre interesting.*
And i also like technology, but protogens aren't really for me. so tada!
